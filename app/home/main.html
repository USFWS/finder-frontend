  <h2>At-Risk Species Snapshot</h2>
  <p>There are currently {{ species.list.length }} Species in the Database:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Petitioned {{ species['Petitioned'].length }}</li>
    <li>Petition Withdrawn {{ species['Petition Withdrawn'].length }}</li>
    <li>Candidate {{ species['Candidate'].length }}</li>
    <li>Candidate Removal {{ species['Candidate Removal'].length }}</li>
    <li>Substantial 90-day Finding {{ species['Substantial 90-day Finding'].length }}</li>
    <li>Not Substantial 90-day Finding {{ species['Not Substantial 90-day Finding'].length }}</li>
    <li>Warranted 12-month Finding {{ species['Warranted 12-month Finding'].length }} </li>
    <li>Not Warranted 12-month Finding {{ species['Not Warranted 12-month Finding'].length }} </li>
    <li>Proposed for Listing as Threatened {{ species['Proposed for Listing as Threatened'].length }}</li>
    <li>Proposed for Listing as Endangered {{ species['Proposed for Listing as Endangered'].length }}</li>
    <li>Final Listing as Threatened {{ species['Final Listing as Threatened'].length }}</li>
    <li>Final Listing as Endangered {{ species['Final Listing as Endangered'].length }}</li>
  </ul>
  <p>{{ species.listed.length }} Species have been protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)</p>
  <p>{{ species.lessProtection.length }} Species do not need additional protection</p>

  <h2>Our Goal</h2>
  <p>Work with public and private partners to proactively conserve as many of these at-risk species as possible over the next decade, and hopefully prevent the need to list them under the Endangered Species Act.</p>

  <h2>What is an At-Risk Species?</h2>
  <p>Biologists commonly refer to species as “at-risk” if they face possible extinction, or extirpation from a geographic area.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of this conservation strategy, the Service’s Southeast Region has defined “at-risk species” as those species that have either been proposed for listing, are candidates for listing, or have been petitioned for listing.</p>
