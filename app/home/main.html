  <h2>Our Goal</h2>
  <p>Work with public and private partners to proactively conserve as many of these at-risk species as possible over the next decade, and hopefully prevent the need to list them under the Endangered Species Act.</p>

  <h2>What is an At-Risk Species?</h2>
  <p>Biologists commonly refer to species as “at-risk” if they face possible extinction, or extirpation from a geographic area.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of this conservation strategy, the Service’s Southeast Region has defined “at-risk species” as those species that have either been proposed for listing, are candidates for listing, or have been petitioned for listing.</p>
